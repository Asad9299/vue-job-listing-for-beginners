- **Loops**: Implement loops in your templates to dynamically render lists of items.
- **Reusable Components**: Create and use reusable components to build a modular application.
- **JSON Server for Mocking Data**: Set up a JSON server to mock API endpoints for CRUD operations.
- **Proxy for JSON Server**: Configure a proxy to handle requests between your Vue application and the JSON server.
- **Add/Edit/Delete Jobs**: Implement functionality to add, edit, and delete job entries in your application.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (12.x or later)
- npm (6.x or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/vue-job-listing-for-beginners.git
    cd vue-job-listing-for-beginners
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Project

To start the development server and the JSON server, use the following commands:

1. **Start the Vue development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This command will run your Vue 3 application in development mode. The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

2. **Start the JSON server:**

    ```bash
    npm run server 5000
    ```

    This command will start the JSON server on port 5000. The server will provide mock data for CRUD operations. It will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

- Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to see the Vue application in action.
- Use the UI to add, edit, and delete job entries.
- View toast notifications for various actions.
